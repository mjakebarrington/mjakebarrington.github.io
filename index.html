        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Michael Barrington, but I go by Jake.
            I am currently seeking work either remote or in the Burlington, VT area.
            I am also <em>possibly</em> open to hybrid work in the Boston area.
            I enjoy learning new things and have a passion for technology.
            Most recently I have been playing around with diffusion models.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attended The University of Vermont from 2014 to 2016 where I studied biology.
            I earned a Web Development Certificate from the Burlington Code Academy in 2018.
            Due to a difficult family situation at the time I continued to work as a flooring installer
            and have now begun to get back into programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have diverse array of interests beyond technology. I enjoy human languages
            and taught myself Spanish, which I can speak at a conversational level&#8212;albeit a bit slow.
